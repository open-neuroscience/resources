## a template to contact projects on github
This might be useful for other platforms, such as hackaday.io, gitlab, wikifactory, etc.




Hello!

This is a message on behalf of the [Open Neuroscience](<https://open-neuroscience.com>) project, which lists open projects in neuroscience. It is a community run project, for curating and highlighting open source projects related to neurosciences.

The project has a website where short project descriptions are listed, with links to the projects themselves and their authors, including images and other links. 

New entries are moderated. Once published, they are announced on [Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@open_neuroscience), [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/open-neuroscience.com) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/open-neuroscience)


**To add their project(s), developers only need to fill out and submit this [form](https://forms.gle/ByM8thAhZJkHBMQN8)**
Remember to subfields and tags to your entries, so that projects become filterable and searchable on the website.

The form system makes contribution open for everyone to contribute and allows developers themselves to describe their projects. Also, there are so many amazing projects coming out in Neurosciences that it would be impossible for a single entity to keep track and log them all!

Open Neuroscience tech stack leverages open source tools as much as possible:
- The website is based on HUGO + Academic Theme
- Everything is hosted on github [here](https://github.com/open-neuroscience)
- It uses [plausible.io](https://[plausible.io) to show visit stats on the website. It respects visitors privacy and doesn't install any cookies.
- visitor stats are available [here](https://plausible.io/open-neuroscience.com?period=60d)

Please [contact](mailto:info@open-neuroscience.com) if you have any questions or would like to collaborate.
