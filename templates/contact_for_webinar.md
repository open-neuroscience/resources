## a template to contact developers to give a talk about their project

Hope this email finds you well.

I am reaching out on behalf of [Open Neuroscience](https://open-neuroscience.com) (a community-run project, curating and highlighting open source projects related to neurosciences), as we would love to have Trackoscope featured on the Seminar series we organize in collaboration with [World Wide Science]([url](https://www.world-wide.org/)).

The goal of this seminar series is to highlight projects that are listed in our website and allow developers to show their projects and get feedback from the community.

If this is interesting for you and your lab, could you please fill out this [form](https://forms.office.com/e/xmkaapqVDg), this would allow us to start preparing things on our side. 

Dates and times are flexible, but we would like to have about 2-3 weeks time between confirming the webinar, so that we can properly advertise it. 

We will then organize the seminar and announce it using the [World wide Science]([url](https://www.world-wide.org/Open-Source/)) platform and on social media through the Open Neuroscience and World Wide Science twitter accounts.

The format for the seminar is really flexible, and we are initially suggesting a 30-45 min talk, followed up by questions from the audience. In total, we are aiming to have a 60-min session.

We are looking forward to your reply and to attending an amazing seminar about Trackoscope.

Best regards, 
Andre on behalf of the Open Neuroscience team
